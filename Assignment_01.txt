ETL = Extract → Transform → Load

Data is:

Extracted from sources

Transformed (cleaned, processed) before storage

Loaded into a data warehouse

👉 Processing happens before storing.

🧠 Used when:

Data warehouse is traditional (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server)

You need to clean/shape data before storage

Data volume is medium/large but not huge

ELT = Extract → Load → Transform

Data is:

Extracted

Loaded directly to the warehouse/lake

Transformed inside the warehouse itself

👉 Processing happens after storing — using the compute power of modern cloud warehouses.

🧠 Used when:

Using cloud warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake)

Data volume is very large (TB–PB scale)

Raw data must be stored for auditing, ML, analytics

🚀 Why ETL & ELT Are Different (Backend Perspective)
Factor	ETL	ELT
Where transformation happens?	On an external ETL engine (tool)	Inside the warehouse (SQL engine)
Compute Power	Limited (depends on tool/server)	Massive (Snowflake/BigQuery scale-out clusters)
Data Load	Clean data loaded	Raw data loaded
Performance for big data	Slower	Very fast (distributed computing)
Storage cost	Higher (cleaning first → losing raw data)	Lower (cloud storage is cheap)
Flexibility	Less flexible	High (you can re-transform any time)
💡 Backend reason for the shift:

Cloud warehouses allow parallel processing, automatic scaling, and columnar storage, making transformations extremely fast.

So ELT is the modern standard for big data.

🛠️ 3 Popular ETL Tools (with deep explanation)
1️⃣ Apache NiFi

Uses an internal queue + backpressure system

Guarantees data provenance (audit trail of every event)

Why it’s good

Ideal for streaming + real-time

Visual UI

Extremely customizable

2️⃣ Talend
What it does

Batch ETL

Complex transformations

Enterprise integration

Backend working

Generates Java code for every transformation

Executes on Talend engine

Uses internal components for joins, filters, mappings

Stores metadata in Talend Repository

Why it’s good

Great for complex business logic

Highly customizable

Strong enterprise support

3️⃣ Informatica PowerCenter
What it does

Large enterprise ETL

Heavy data quality logic

Many prebuilt connectors

Backend working

Uses integration service to run transformations

Reads from source, uses internal DTM (Data Transformation Manager)

Applies transformations row by row

Writes output to target tables or files

Why it’s good

High performance

Used by banks, telecom, retail

Mature product with governance tools

🛠️ 3 Popular ELT Tools (with deep explanation)
1️⃣ Fivetran
What it does

Automated connectors

ELT into warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery

Loads raw data and auto-creates schemas

Backend working

Fivetran agents pull incremental data

Data copied to warehouse using bulk APIs

Transformations written in SQL and executed in warehouse

Metadata stored in Fivetran’s control plane

Why it’s good

Fully managed

No maintenance

Best for analytics teams

2️⃣ Google BigQuery (ELT built-in)
What it does

Serverless cloud warehouse

Stores raw data

Executes SQL transformations at massive scale

Backend working

Uses Dremel engine (distributed execution)

Columnar storage + tree architecture

Scales compute per query

Transformations done using SQL (ELT) on raw tables

Why it’s good

No servers to manage

Extremely fast scans

Great for ML + analytics

3️⃣ Snowflake (ELT leader)
What it does

Cloud warehouse

Loads raw data into stages

Transformations done using SQL, Snowpipe, or dbt

Backend working

Separates compute, storage, services

Compute clusters called virtual warehouses

Storage is columnar and encrypted

ELT transformations run using distributed SQL engine

Why it’s good

Auto-scaling

High concurrency

Excellent for ELT workflows

🧠 Why ELT Became More Popular (Technical Reasoning)

Cloud compute is cheap and scalable

Snowflake/BigQuery scale horizontally

ETL tools can't match that performance

Raw data is valuable

You can reprocess any time

Good for data science & ML

Schema evolution support

Modern warehouses handle semi-structured data (JSON, Avro, Parquet)

Columnar storage + vectorized execution

Makes transformations extremely fast

Separation of storage & compute

You can run many transformations in parallel
